            The respiratory system consists of a series of organs; the nasal
            cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and lungs
            (alveoli). The nasal cavity and pharynx are together called the
            upper respiratory system, while the remainder of the organs comprise
            the lower respiratory system.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            Respiratory system organs, with the exception of the alveoli,
            function to conduct air into the lungs aided by the muscles of
            respiration (mainly the diaphragm and intercostal muscles).

            The vessels of the cardiovascular system are the heart, arteries,
            capillaries, and veins. This is a transport system, within which the
            blood is propelled by the heart in a closed circuit through vessels.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            The regulation of the cardiovascular system occurs via an
            innumerable number of stimuli, including changing blood volume,
            hormones, electrolytes, osmolarity, medications, adrenal glands,
            kidneys, and much more. The parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous
            systems also play a key role in the regulation of the cardiovascular
            system[2].

            Morphologically and topographically, the nervous system is divided
            into the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Whilst
            functionally, the nervous system is considered as two parts; the
            somatic (SNS) or voluntary nervous system, and the autonomic (ANS)
            or involuntary nervous system.
          </dd>
          <dd>
            The peripheral nervous system definition is that it conducts
            information from the CNS to the target tissues, and from the target
            tissues to the CNS. It consists of nerves and their ganglia.
